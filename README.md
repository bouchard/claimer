# Claimer

Claimer is a Ruby library for preparing, formatting and submitting claim submissions for Medicare services provided by physicians in Canada. Each province uses a different process for submissions - this library aims to abstract away these differences.

## Currently Working

* **Saskatchewan** (hospital and out-of-hospital billing).

# TODO

* Every other province.
* Support for out-of-province billing.
